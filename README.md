**VLRSBot** is a Discord bot developed using Python 3.9. It was created to manage community events and reward participants with virtual coins, which could be exchanged for special roles within the server.

## About The Project

This project was developed as a personal tool to facilitate community engagement on Discord. After each event, winners were manually awarded coins. These coins could then be used to purchase Discord roles that granted various perks within the server.

The bot was initially hosted on Google Cloud and later migrated to a personal Raspberry Pi for self-hosting.
