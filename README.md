# VLRSBot
Just a discord bot i made for myself !
We basically hosted community events. After each event, we manually gave coins to the winners.
Event winners could then buy discord roles after saving coins. The roles would grant them perks within the server.
The bot was firstly hosted on Google Cloud, until I hosted it on my personal Raspberry PI.
